The goal of this game is for the kritter to be able to carve out as much space as possible on the 
screen before the monster gets to it. If the kritter runs into the monster or is unable to create 
space for itself before the monster reaches the kritter or an open area then the player loses. 
There is a score tally on the top right hand that displays the percentage of the grid that the player 
owns currently as they acquire more space. There are also two buttons- a pause and play button that 
the player can use at anytime to stop or start the game again. 

Pressing ENTER at any time restarts the game.
Use the Arrow keys to navigate and draw boxes using edge of bounds or existing territory. Draw corners
of boxes in open field and close the box to seal the gap, but do not step on your own trail before you 
claim your territory or you will die. Try to claim 50% of the field to win.
