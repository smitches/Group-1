- In the novelvisualization.pde, we decided to use a larger font along with the font type courier since this was an easily legible font. The colors that we picked were red, blue and white since we decided to represent the text in a format to represent the American flag. 

- In the wordFrequency.pde, we manipulated the data a bit. We realized that 1: 10718, meant all the words in the book that at least appeared once. We went ahead and manipulate the data to get an array with all the words that ONLY appeared N amount of times in the book. N = {1, 2, 3, â€¦,8015}. We called that array our diffArray, and then we convert those numbers into degrees to put in our pie chart. We noticed that when N >= 16, the degree is around 1 degree or less than 1 degree, thus we group them together into one big group, (this group is represented with the color white in the pie chart). The biggest chunk of the pie chart are the words that only appeared once and in the book, it around half of the pie, and you will notice that as the N increases the the pie piece becomes smaller and smaller.
