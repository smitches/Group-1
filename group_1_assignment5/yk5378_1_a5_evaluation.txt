Assignment 5 Team Evaluations:

Brian Smith-Eitches started on our assignment and made these cool two stacks of boxes that rotate and then coming in together. Brain also helped out Krishti with her part of the assignment, I couldn't help because at the time I was on the road to Colorado.

Krishti worked on the 4 balls rotating and coming back and forth between the screen and the project description. 

I was in charge of of the upside down jack in the boxes and the README.txt
