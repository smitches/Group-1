Rachel did part 1. She ran into trouble implementing the slider but figured it out.

Brian did part 2. He spent a long time doing the actual search, and the code did not end up looking tidy.
He also decided to put in a "random" button which made the search button more obsolete

Krish did part 3. She figured out the XML and only had trouble with next and previous buttons. 
Brian and Krish worked together to figure out the next and previous buttons.
